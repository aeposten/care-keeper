      <p>
        Care Keeper is a top-rate application for pet-sitters, designed with the necessities of pet care in mind. The app was created by two coding students with a personal history in the veterinary field - Amy was a technician, and Shannon was both a receptionist and a veterinary assistant. While no longer in that field, both Amy and Shannon still have a big ol' soft spot in their hearts for all pets, especially their own. Those behind Care Keeper know that it's important to clearly store and organize the information for your pet-sitting clients.
